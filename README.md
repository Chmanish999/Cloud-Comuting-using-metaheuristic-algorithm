An NLP-Based Approach for Optimising Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing using Different Meta-Heuristic Algorithms
Organizing tasks efficiently is crucial for optimizing the performance of cloud computing. Our research study introduces a novel ML-based method to assess and rank algorithms for task scheduling, taking into account their characteristics. Through the utilization of Google  Drive  and  the  SpaCy  English  model  for  data  extraction,  we  detect  and  measure  significant  descriptive  terms  associated with algorithm features. By assigning priorities based upon our algorithm  to these terms espically based on their frequencies, we are able to determine  the  relative  significance  of  each  feature.  By  amalgamating  these  priorities,  we  calculate  priority  scores  for  each algorithm, unveiling  their  potential  for  performance.  The  optimal  task  scheduling  algorithm  can  be  known    by analyzing  the  priority  scores.  By showing these scores using a X-Y plot helps users easily understand and compare the different algorithms. Our unique approach allows personal  or  enterprise  users  to  make  informed  decisions,  thereby  optimizing  the  utilization  of  cloud  resources  and  improving  overall efficiency. This research study  proposes an Natural Language Processing -driven methodology supported by data to navigate various task scheduling algorithms, ultimately enhancing cloud computing performance. The power of artificial intelligence immensely helps toachieve better resource utilization and improved performance in cloud environments
